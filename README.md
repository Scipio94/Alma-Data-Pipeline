# Alma API

## Alma

Alma is a student information system (SIS) used by Foundation Academies Charter School in Trention, New Jersey. It houses a variety of student information and metrics essential to the school's function. It is also used for reporting. To automate the reporting process I established an API connection to perform ETL in Python and create a data pipeline to BigQuery.
